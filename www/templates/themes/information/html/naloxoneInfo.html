                        Information About Naloxone
                    </h2>

                    <p class="content">
                        Naloxone is a FDA - approved medication commonly
referred to as the 'opioid antagonist'. It is used to counteract the
effects of opioid overdoses, specifically, life-threatening overdose effects
that would otherwise not let an overdose victim breathe correctly. Naloxone
is a non-addictive medication that can be administered through the nose and
purchased over the counter. Naloxone will only work on people that have
opioids in their system and will not have any negative side effects on
non-opioid users if administered. It is a temporary drug that wears off in
minutes.  Naloxone comes in many forms to administer however the most rapid
is via nasal administration.  We recommend using the nasal form given its
rapid ease of administration and simplicity.
