                        LifeKit for Opioid Users
                    </h2>

                    <p class="content2">
                        LifeKit is the first and most innovative
wearable-integrated, vital monitoring application aimed at helping solve the
opioid overdose epidemic. The goal of this application is help opioid users
overcome deadly overdoses by monitoring vital signs through wearable
technology. LifeKit aims to detect overdoses before fatal incidents happen
and save lives by sending alerts to nearby emergency responders, naloxone
carriers, family members, and doctors.
						  </p>
						 <p class="content2">
To use the application -  simply download and register within the
application as an opioid user. After registration is complete, a short
tutorial and calibration with your integrated wearable device will be
required. You're all set to go, simply keep the application running the
background and have your wearable device on you during opioid usage.  
                    </p>

								LifeKit for Naloxone Carriers
						  </h1>
						  <p class = "content2">
							LifeKit is a simple, yet life changing application
that could help good samaritans become heroes. By carrying naloxone and
using this application, users will be alerted of nearby potentially fatal
overdose incidents. Users will, then, be able to respond in the nick of time
and save overdose victims by administering naloxone and reversing the
effects of the overdose almost immediately. 
						  </p>
						  <p class = "content2">
To use the application -  simply download and register within the
application as a naloxone carrier. After registration is complete, you will
be required to watch a short tutorial on naloxone administering. You're
all set to go and save lives, simply carry naloxone with you at all times
and having the application running in the background.
