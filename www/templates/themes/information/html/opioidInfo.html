Opioids are a class of medications that specializes in pain relief. Opioids
essentially reduce pain by lessening the intensity of the pain signals
reaching the brain. Several different medications fall under this class,
some of the more common ones are hydrocodone, oxycodone, morphine, and
codeine. These medications are used for an array of different pain
scenarios, such as, injury-related pain and pain from post-surgical
procedures. No matter what the opioid prescribed is, excessive use of an
opioid can be fatal.
