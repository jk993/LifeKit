                  The Opioid Risk Tool (ORT) is a brief, self-report
screening tool designed for use with adults patients in primary care
settings to assess risk for opioid abuse among individuals prescibed opioids
for treatment of chronic pain. Patients categorized as high-risk are at
increased likelihood of future abusive drug-related behavior. The ORT can be
adminsitered and scored in less than 1 minute and has been validated in both
male and female patients, but not in non-pain populations.
